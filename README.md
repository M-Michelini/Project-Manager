# Project-Manager
A basic project manger application. First collaborative project with [@Maverink](https://github.com/Maverink). This repo holds a fullstack MERN stack application to help with project management, /server holds the code for the express API and /client holds the code for the React front-end. For now we will use this read me to keep track of the following;

# SETUP

### API
I'm currently coding on a local environment, you will need node v11.6.0 and git installed on your local environment, it can be a bit weird to get installed properly apparently, but I've got it going on windows 10 and linux and have had no issues. Once you have the pre-requisites installed open a terminal and cd into the directory that you want to store the code on your local storage (eg. C:\Users\Michael\Documents), then enter the terminal commands;
```
  git clone https://github.com/M-Michelini/Project-Manager
  cd ./server
  npm install
  npm start
```

If all went well the terminal should return
```
  Your app is listening on port 3000
```

now open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 you should see an express boilerplate page for now.
